# 🎵 Customer Churn Analysis in Music Streaming Using XAI 🎶

## 📢 Introduction

### 📜 Project Overview

In the highly competitive music streaming industry, retaining customers is crucial. This project aims to analyze customer churn using Explainable AI (XAI) to identify key factors contributing to customer attrition. By understanding these factors, businesses can implement targeted strategies to improve customer retention.

### 🎯 Objectives

- **🔍 Understand Churn Factors**: Identify the reasons why customers are leaving the platform using XAI.
- **📈 Improve Retention Strategies**: Develop strategies to reduce churn and retain more customers.
- **💡 Enhance Customer Satisfaction**: Use insights to improve the overall user experience and satisfaction.

## 🛠 Project Setup and Initialization

### 📝 Define Problem Statement

- **❌ Customer Churn**: High churn rates lead to loss of revenue and increased customer acquisition costs.
- **📉 Decreased Engagement**: Identifying disengaged users early can help in taking proactive measures to retain them.

### 💡 Proposed Solution

Utilize Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to provide insights into the factors driving customer churn. The solution involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model selection, and optimization.

- **🔄 Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, manage outliers, and balance the dataset.
- **📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Discover patterns and insights within the data.
- **🤖 Machine Learning Models**: Implement models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
- **⚙ Model Optimization**: Fine-tune model parameters to improve performance.
